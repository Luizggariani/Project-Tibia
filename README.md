![Tibia icon](https://www.tibiawiki.com.br/images/7/76/Tibia_icon.png)


## Description of the project and objectives to do:

This is a project that I'm going to do to learn more about the Python Language, SQL and a DBMS and then using PowerBI to show some of the data extracted from the API of Tibia.

1. Tibia API

2. Objective of this project

Extract the data from the API of Tibia in creatures (https://api.tibiadata.com/v4/creatures) and insert into a MySQL database.

In the MySQL you should create a database called "Tibia" and a schema called "tibia_api" and a table called "creatures" with the following columns:

- 'name'
- 'race'
- 'image_url'
- 'featured'

Here is the documentation to download MySQL: https://www.mysql.com/

The table in MySQL should have 638 rows as the API had in the moment that I wrote this README ('26/09/2024').
